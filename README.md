# This is the server part of a E-commerce Angular project.

Parts that have been commented out, are some of the admin-related functions to allow admins to upload, edit and remove products. These options has been purposely disabled due to Heroku's free tierlist's limitations.
These functions are fully functional and working as designed.
The project is being hosted [here](https://adoring-mayer-5b9576.netlify.app/).
The server is hosted on Heroku's free tier, and because of that the first connection to the server might be slow.
